The chairman of the KWT, Mike Bax, has faced backlash from environmentalists and Kent residents due to his misleading habits. Bax is an active for-pleasure huntsman whose ‘games’ endanger the wildlife in Kent. The Brown Hare, listed as a priority species under the UK’s Biodiversity Action Plan, is also directly endangered by Bax’s actions. Because of this, Bax is viewed as an unfit chairman.

                                After witnessing the endangerment of the chimps, Goodall decided to dedicate her life to animal activism. Goodall is 
                                considered the world’s foremost chimpanzee expert. She spent years observing a family of chimps and is credited with the first ever recorded observation of chimps eating meat 
                                and making tools (Biography). Goodall was also able to end the misconception that all chimpanzees were vegetarian when she observed their hunting and feeding skills. Jane Goodall became the author of 
                                twelve books, namely In the Shadow of Man, in addition to numerous articles. Overall, Goodall’s research has set an example of wholesome observation practices for future scientists to live by.</p>
